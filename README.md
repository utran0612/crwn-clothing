# Y-life

## Introduction
This is an e-commerce web application dedicated to selling second-hand stuff. My motivation to build this is to learn Javascript, React and delve into React hooks, React's life cycle, payment flow and authentication flow. 

## Tech stack
- Javascript
- React

## Usage

Clone it!

```
$ git clone [https://github.com/utran0612/y-life.git](https://github.com/utran0612/y-life.git)
```

Go to the project directory and run the command:

```
$ yarn start
```

## Future contribution

- Touch up the payment page
- Build more interactive UI
