# Y-life

## Introduction
This is an e-commerce web application dedicated to selling second-hand stuff. My motivation to build this is to learn Javascript, React and delve into React hooks, React's life cycle, payment flow and authentication flow. 

Users can view products, log in by email address or Google account, add products to the cart, and make a payment.

## Tech stack
- Javascript
- React
